## Bio
Sudipto Das is a Principal Engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS). He works on [Amazon Timestream](https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/) a fast, scalable, fully-managed, serverless time series database offering in the AWS Database Services umbrella.

Sudipto is an engineering and research leader best known for his work on scalable database management systems for cloud platforms. His expertise spans the broad area of scalable database management systems. He has worked on several facets such as distributed query processing, efficient resource management for cloud database infrastructures, automated tuning (in particular automated indexing) of relational database-as-a-service, performance isolation, and scale-out transaction processing systems leveraging modern hardware paradigms.

Prior to AWS, Sudipto was a Senior Researcher the Data Management, Exploration, and Mining (DMX) group at Microsoft Research (MSR). At MSR, his research has shaped several key features and business offerings in [Microsoft’s Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/) platform. His work in the [SQLVM](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sqlvm-performance-isolation-in-multi-tenant-relational-database-as-a-service/) project formed the basis of CPU performance isolation capabilities, which was exposed as the new [Service Tiers and Performance Levels](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn741336.aspx), made generally available in September 2014 for Azure SQL Database, and new resource governance functionality in SQL Server 2016. His work also significantly improved efficiency of Azure DB’s infrastructure with new node-local and cluster-wide resource management mechanisms and policies. He also led the project on automated indexing has significantly enhanced the ability to automatically recommend a variety of index structures (shipped with [Database Tuning Advisor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/columnstore-index-recommendations-in-database-engine-tuning-advisor-dta?view=sql-server-2017) along with [SQL Server 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/whats-new-in-sql-server-2017?view=sql-server-2017)) and significant enhancements to index recommendations in the [Auto-indexing offering](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/artificial-intelligence-tunes-azure-sql-databases/) in Azure SQL Database.

Sudipto holds a PhD in Computer Science from University of California, Santa Barbara. His PhD thesis research on developing scalable, elastic, and autonomic transaction processing  systems  to  support  cloud  application  platforms  won  several  awards  including  the  ACM SIGMOD Jim Gray Dissertation Award (the highest award given to a PhD dissertation in the database area) and the UC Santa Barbara Graduate division’s Lancaster Award (given to one PhD dissertation in the class  of PhDs in the  areas of Engineering, Mathematics,  and Sciences  at UC Santa  Barbara). He has published more than twenty papers at top-tier database conferences which have been cited more than 3300 times and is the recipient of a Best Paper and a Best Paper Runner-up award.

Sudipto is well-known for his expertise in database systems. He regularly serves on the program committees of top-tier database conferences, is an Associate Editor for the Journal on Distributed and Parallel  Databases,  and  has  delivered  invited  lectures  and  Keynotes  at  database  conferences.  His research has also resulted in several patents granted and currently in review.

Sudipto is originally from the “City of Joy” Kolkata in India. His undergraduate study was in Jadavpur University, Kolkata where he completed my Bachelor of Engineering from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
